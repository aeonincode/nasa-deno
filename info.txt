You can try ensuring the permissions on the src/ folder are correct by running chmod 755 src and rebuilding your docker file with docker build --no-cache -t aeon-nasa-deno .

You could double check it the src directory is available in your Container by starting a interactive shell in your container with

docker exec -it containerName bash
To make your life easier, you can also give your docker container a name by running

docker run â€“it â€“â€“name=containerName -p 8000:8000 aeonincode/nasa-deno

To show only running containers use the given command:

docker ps
To show all containers use the given command:

docker ps -a
To show the latest created container (includes all states) use the given command:

In the new version of Docker, commands are updated, and some management commands are added:

docker container ls
It is used to list all the running containers.

docker container ls -a
And then, if you want to clean them all,

docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
It is used to list all the containers created irrespective of its state.

And to stop all the Docker containers (force)

docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)  
Here the container is the management command.
